So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road.With much awe in their area of sinful desserts, this cafe is a frequent spot for many celebrities due to their amazing and delicious quality of food that is simply mind-blowing. They even have a beautifuloutdoor seating and the staff is quite accomodative. Must haves: Chai, Chicken Pasta, Shakes, Waffles, Chocolate Croissant, Jalapeno Poppers and Samosa.</p>

    <p class="text-muted text-left">Jantar Mantar in Jaipur has captured the essence of many a wanderlust over the years. An open-air astronomical observatory, this UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the rare and timeless places of attraction in Jaipur, and the world.

      With an illuminating history that predates modern civilization, this observatory was far ahead of its time and showcased the ancient ways of reading stars and skies. Built in the early 18th century by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, it is a conglomeration of fixed stones and very large structures. Each has its specific usage. The main reason for it being built was because of the Maharaja’s fascination with celestial objects and movement of different bodies in the sky.</p>

      <p class="text-success text-left text-muted">But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...

        The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.
        
        To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.
        
        And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.
        
        To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.
        
        It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them</p>

      <p class="text-success text-left text-muted">It may be a long time before viewers can appreciate the 2019 remake of "The Lion King" as a freestanding work, instead of judging it against the original. The 1994 version was "Hamlet" plus "Bambi" on the African veldt: a childhood-shaping, Oscar-winning blockbuster, the second-highest grossing feature film of its calendar year, one of the last great hand-drawn Disney animated features (Pixar's original "Toy Story" came out 18 months later), and a tear-producing machine. This remake was controversial long before it opened, mainly because it seemed to take the Walt Disney company's new branding strategy—remaking beloved animated films as CGI-dependent "live action" spectaculars—to its most drastic conclusion. It serves up the same story with different actors, different arrangements of beloved songs and soundtrack cues, a couple of original tunes, a few fresh scenes and sequences, and, of course, photorealistic animals. The latter are the movie's main selling point, so believable that one of my kids remarked afterward that sitting through the film was like watching a nature documentary on mute while the soundtrack to original "The Lion King" played in the background.</p>

      <p class="text-success text-left text-muted">When Frozen came out, kids and adults were in love with the story and loveable characters. The film even won the best animated movie of the year award. But is Frozen really as good as people say? It doesn't seem to be that much different from a lot of Disney movies with love as the moral. And soon people started to dislike Frozen because of how popular its become. This same pattern happened with Moana, too. And here is what happens: when new Disney films get released, everyone goes to watch them. Then people talk about the new movie on social media. This makes sure that everyone knows about the movie. And over time with everyone talking about the movie, people start to get sick of it. It didn't help that people are digging up some stuff about Frozen that make you not want to watch it. I think there is a great message for young kids, but the characters aren't exactly good role models. Elsa start a huge storm in her kingdom and the runs away from everyone. Then Anna goes after Elsa leaving her kingdom defenceless against the winter. It's not good for kids to think that running away from your problems is ok.</p>

     LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and considering other options,
    which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year.
    While LEGO wants to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have,
     especially with the effective "clicking" together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.
